This project was a random phrase generator, that given a certain type of formatted list of words, we are to create a random phrase from that list in Java. We are also to make this in the shortest run time we could. This was done with a partner, where we both worked on it together.

Some of the things to take away from this project is teamwork, and learning to get work together with someone else and be able to communicate to complete the task. Another thing to take away from this is the thought process on runtime, and how different types of data structures, and functions will affect the running time of the code, and the tradeoffs of data structures compared to its run time.

Unfortunately I do not have the source code for this project.
