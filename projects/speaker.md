During Honolulu Community College Engineering Academy, we created a bluetooth speaker, using the knowledge of circuits, and Soldering, we created a small speaker with the capability of bluetooth. This and other projects were done at this Summer Academy where we were taught skills regarding Electrical Engineering, Like Soldering, 3d Printing/CAD, and use of the Multimeter tool.

This was an interesting class to take as It taught many different things in the Electrical Engineering side. It also helped form teams and friendships in this class to help facilitate teamwork.
