## First One.
Coding standards, in which you have a system of how you are to write your code, i.e. how many spaces, indentation or how you close a line. If you are to hold up to a coding standard you are expected to do the same little details all the way through your code. This creates a consistent and “clear” way for people and you later to read your code. 


## Second One
I see this as an important skill in general to a certain degree. Coding standards will help make your code more visible for others, and is great for when working with others, as well as yourself because then you can make certain ways to structure your code to not get confused about it. I think it is best to come up with your own coding standards that helps you organize your code, while giving you more flexibility to what you do.




## Thrid One
I am trying coding with a pre-established coding standard which is ESLint. Doing this is just really annoying. It’s way too stingy on the things you need to do. Space after a {, ( but not before, how much space you can make, you can’t indent here. It is just more annoying than anything, just having to do this small thing. It's both a blessing and a curse. Making my code look more consistent and cleaner to a certain extent, at the cost of expression and my own personal frustration dealing with fixing the problems ESLint has with my code.
