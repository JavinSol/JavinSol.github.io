## Very familiar yet very different.

Javascript is both similar and different to other programming languages. The one thing that stands out to me is how more open this language is. Comparing it to Java, In Java you need to specify what type each of your 
objects are, a certain type to return, so if you wanted to have a function that returns either an int or string, nope. But in Javascript you don’t need to assign each variable to a specific type of object. Meaning you can 
just create a variable that can take different types, a function that is to return different types like a string if it failed but an integer if it worked. A lot more ease of access for the programmer. It does feel weird
from switching from a very specific language like Java to a more broad thing like Javascript. But other than the objects, Javascript has felt the same as Java, with very similar syntax.

## The good and bad of Javascript

Now is it a good or bad programming language? Javascript is a good tool if used to its strength, Aka using it for Web development. Like any tool it's going to have its uses and areas that it won’t excel in.  Also for
someone with some coding experience in other languages, Javascript is very similar to them so picking up the syntaxes and quirks have been easier. But some of the things that give me worry when using Javascript is the use
of different object types. Because you can use and receive different object types, this makes me feel a little afraid that if the wrong type is imputed, it will break the code. This is mainly a fear because Java was my
first programming language that I learned and It instilled into me that I need to label everything into a certain type.


## Fast Pace High Octane Learning: Athletic Software Engineering

For me, athletic software engineering is both a boon and bane. Athletic software engineering is a great way to teach others about discipline and keep someone in a timely manner. Having to go through a lot of materials in
a fast paced time is good practice. But I feel this type of learning has some big downsides. It's so easy to fall behind with a big workload in a short amount of time, and once you fall behind it seems near impossible to 
dig your way through back to where you are supposed to be. And for people who are slower learners and take more time to absorb information this can be detrimental to them if they also have other obligations to do. Plus as 
the workload gets harder and harder, it's going to put a lot of stress on people, with little breathing room. I know it's going to be hard work, heavy and hard and can help hone your skills and practice discipline into 
someone, but this is definitely not something for everyone. I see it as being very good learning practice for someone who is passionate about software engineering or someone who needs motivation or discipline in the 
software engineering field.

## Opinions on the WODs 

One of the exercises in this athletic software engineering program is WODs, where we are given a problem that is to be solved in a certain amount of time. This helps well with teaching discipline, practice, repetition,
which will help develop and hone our skills. If you understand the topic, it helps keep that knowledge and gives you a warm up of that knowledge. But a big caveat is the time. Those who are slower at coding or take time 
to figure out a problem might have problems with WODs. This might be a problem in the beginning but as time goes on, and you do more WODs, it will be easier to finish and complete them in the designated time. It's a 
little stressful but not as big as athletic software engineering as a whole.
